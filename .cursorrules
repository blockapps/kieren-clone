# Don't make the user work. 

# If something isn't working, do not immediately assume it is a version compatibility or installation issue.
# First, look in the current version's documentation or code to use functions correctly before switching versions. Only consider versioning or installation problems after exhausting other options. 

# All documentation (including README files) must be kept up to date with code and workflow changes. 

Always pick the thing that's easier for the user, including automatic loading of credentials/configuration.
